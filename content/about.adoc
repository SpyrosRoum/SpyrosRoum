Hello and welcome to my blog! I'm Spyros and this is the place where I write about my ideas and my projects, or about anything else I want to. +
What's the point of having a blog if you can't write whatever you want in it, right?

I like linux and programing so most if not all of my posts will be related to one of these two.

I support free and open source software, thus all my projects are open source and you can find them in my https://github.com/SpyrosRoum[github].
